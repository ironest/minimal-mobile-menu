# minimal-mobile-menu

This project is just a demo.

A random dude from Lagos City (Nigeria) asked me to show him how to recreated in simple html/css/js some functionalities employed at [this website](https://settimetechnologies.com/).

- How to create a navbar with links
- How to open and close a such navbar
- The request was specifically made for mobile devices only.

This repo is not intended to be used in any way other than educational.
